# magnificent

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/magnificent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/magnificent)

magnificent is the reference implementation for the [STUPS authorization dependency spec](https://github.com/zalando-stups/dependency-spec).

## Download

Releases are pushed as Docker images in the [public Docker registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/stups/magnificent/):

* Image: [stups/magnificent](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/stups/magnificent/tags/manage/)

You can run magnificent by starting it with Docker:

    $ docker run -it stups/magnificent

## Configuration

At its heart, magnificent is a rule engine to authorize all API requests from the STUPS infrastructure. It is using
[core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) for evaluating the rule set. Consider writing an own configuration
for your organisation and plug it into magnificent.

### How to write an own configuration

TODO: use "radical-agility" as base for modification, explain core.logic briefly, explain defrule syntax

### How to activate the new configuration

TODO: add to Docker image, pass "ruleset" configuration as start parameter

## Building

    $ lein uberjar
